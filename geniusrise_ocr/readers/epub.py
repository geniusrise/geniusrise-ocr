        r"""
        The `ParseEpub` class is designed to process EPUB files and classify them as either text-based or image-based.
        It takes an input folder containing EPUB files as an argument and iterates through each file.
        For each EPUB, it samples a few items to determine the type of content it primarily contains.
        If the EPUB is text-based, the class extracts the text from each item and saves it as a JSON file.
        If the EPUB is image-based, it saves the images in a designated output folder.

        Args:
            input (BatchInput): An instance of the BatchInput class for reading the data.
            output (BatchOutput): An instance of the BatchOutput class for saving the data.
            state (State): An instance of the State class for maintaining the state.
            **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments.
