        r"""
        The `ParsePostScript` class is designed to process PostScript files and classify them as either text-based or image-based.
        It takes an input folder containing PostScript files as an argument and iterates through each file.
        For each PostScript file, it converts it to PDF and samples a few pages to determine the type of content it primarily contains.
        If the PostScript is text-based, the class extracts the text from each page and saves it as a JSON file.
        If the PostScript is image-based, it converts each page to a PNG image and saves them in a designated output folder.

        Args:
            input (BatchInput): An instance of the BatchInput class for reading the data.
            output (BatchOutput): An instance of the BatchOutput class for saving the data.
            state (State): An instance of the State class for maintaining the state.
            **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments.
