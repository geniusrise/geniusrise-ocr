class ParsePdf(Bolt):

        r"""
        The `ParsePdf` class is designed to process PDF files and classify them as either text-based or image-based.
        It takes an input folder containing PDF files as an argument and iterates through each file.
        For each PDF, it samples a few pages to determine the type of content it primarily contains.
        If the PDF is text-based, the class extracts the text from each page and saves it as a JSON file.
        If the PDF is image-based, it converts each page to a PNG image and saves them in a designated output folder.

            Args:
                input (BatchInput): An instance of the BatchInput class for reading the data.
                output (BatchOutput): An instance of the BatchOutput class for saving the data.
                state (State): An instance of the State class for maintaining the state.
                **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments.
